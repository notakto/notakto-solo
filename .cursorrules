architecture:

  description: |
    The project follows a layered architecture built around clarity and separation of concerns:

    **Flow:**  
    middleware → routes → handler → functions → sqlc (DB)

    **Packages:**
      - **cmd/server/main.go**
        - Application entry point.
        - Registers middlewares and routes.
      - **middleware/**
        - Contains a chain of 3 middlewares, executed in order:
          1. IP-based rate limiter  
          2. Firebase Auth token extractor (sets `uid` in context)  
          3. UID-based rate limiter
      - **routes/**
        - Defines all API endpoints and links each to the correct handler function.
      - **handler/**
        - Handles HTTP requests and responses.
        - Converts incoming JSON → Go types, calls `functions`, then Go types → JSON for the response.
      - **functions/**
        - Contains all business logic.
        - May call multiple SQL or logic functions as needed.
        - Uses only `sqlc`-generated DB methods for database access.
      - **db/**
        - Contains SQL migrations (managed by Goose).
        - Holds `sqlc`-generated DB query code.
      - **types/**
        - Contains shared Go structs, validators, enums, and common types.
        - Used by both `handler` and `functions` to ensure consistent type definitions and validation logic.

rules:
  - Always maintain the strict call order:
      middleware → routes → handler → functions → sqlc
  - No business logic in routes or handlers.
  - Middlewares must be reusable and never depend on handlers or functions.
  - Only `functions` layer may directly call `sqlc` DB methods.
  - All data validation and reusable struct definitions go in the `types` package.
  - All env must be set in config/env.go only 
  - Handlers should:
      1. Parse and validate JSON input using `types` structs and validators.
      2. Call the appropriate `functions` method.
      3. Return JSON-formatted response.
  - Functions must not do request/response JSON marshaling/unmarshaling.
  - Prefer context-aware functions (`ctx context.Context`) across all layers.
  - SQL changes must be applied via Goose migrations under `db/migrations`, followed by regenerating sqlc code.
  - No hardcoded queries outside of sqlc-generated code.
  - When creating a new endpoint:
      1. Define route in `routes/`
      2. Implement handler in `handler/`
      3. Add corresponding logic in `functions/`
      4. Define any new structs or validators in `types/`
      5. **Create a test file for the endpoint under `tests/`**
         - Tests must cover success and failure cases.
         - Use mocked dependencies for database or external calls.

code_style:
  - Use idiomatic Go naming:
      - PascalCase for exported names (types, funcs, structs)
      - camelCase for local variables
  - Avoid global state; inject dependencies where needed.
  - Keep each function focused and small (SRP - Single Responsibility Principle).
  - Error handling must be explicit (`if err != nil { return ... }`).
  - For logging or debugging, prefer context-aware logging.

conventions:
  - Route definitions live in `routes/*.go` and call handlers from `handler/`.
  - Handler request/response structs and validators live in `types/` if reused, or locally in the handler if unique.
  - Shared domain structs (used by multiple layers) must live in `types/`.
  - Firebase `uid` must always be read from `context.Context`.
  - All environment variables and configs should be centralized in a `config/` package.
  - Package imports:
      - Never import `handler` or `routes` inside `functions` or `middleware`.
      - `functions` may import `db` and `types`.
      - `handler` may import `functions` and `types`.

cursor:
  goals:
    - Maintain the architecture integrity when generating new code.
    - Suggest correct file placement and imports for new features.
    - Enforce that all new logic goes inside `functions`, not handlers.
    - Auto-complete SQL queries and Go structs using existing schema and `types`.
    - Keep request/response JSON marshaling/unmarshaling confined to `handler` layer only.
    - Automatically generate test skeletons when new endpoints are created.

naming_conventions:
  - Routes: 
  - Handler functions: `Handle<Action>` (e.g., `HandleCreateSession`)
  - Functions layer: `<Action><Entity>` (e.g., `CreateSession`, `GetUserStats`)
  - Types:
      - Request structs: `<Action><Entity>Request`
      - Response structs: `<Action><Entity>Response`
      - Validators: `<Entity>Validator`
